# 🌌 Solar System Features - Enhanced Planetary Simulation

## New Features Added

### 🌟 Multi-Planet Solar System Support
- **Multiple Planets**: Create solar systems with unlimited planets, each with customizable properties
- **Realistic Orbital Mechanics**: Planets orbit around a central sun with configurable speeds and distances
- **Scalable Planetary Sizes**: Adjust planet sizes from tiny asteroids to gas giants

### 🌙 Advanced Multiple Moon System
- **Multiple Moons per Planet**: Each planet can have multiple moons orbiting around it
- **Independent Orbital Parameters**: Each moon has its own size, orbit distance, and orbital speed
- **Realistic Moon Dynamics**: Moons orbit their parent planets while planets orbit the sun

### 💍 Enhanced Planetary Rings
- **Customizable Ring Systems**: Add Saturn-like rings to any planet
- **Configurable Ring Properties**: Adjust inner/outer radius, opacity, and appearance
- **Multiple Ring Types**: Support for different ring configurations per planet

### 🎮 Interactive Controls
- **Mode Switching**: Toggle between Single Planet and Solar System modes
- **Quick Presets**: Instant creation of Earth-Moon, Jupiter, Saturn, or Mini Solar Systems
- **Custom Planet Builder**: Create planets with custom names, textures, sizes, and orbital properties
- **Real-time Animation Controls**: Enable/disable planetary rotation with time scaling

### 🎨 Planet Texture System
- **Built-in Textures**: Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Venus, Mercury, and Pluto textures
- **Easy Texture Assignment**: Apply any texture to any planet
- **Fallback System**: Graceful degradation when textures fail to load

## How to Use

### Quick Start
1. **Switch to Solar System Mode**: Click the "🌌 Solar System" button
2. **Try Presets**: Use quick preset buttons for instant solar systems
3. **Enable Animation**: Toggle "Real-time Rotation" for dynamic movement

### Creating Custom Planets
1. Enter a planet name (e.g., "Tatooine")
2. Select texture from dropdown
3. Adjust size, orbit distance, and speed using sliders
4. Optionally add planetary rings
5. Add multiple moons with individual properties
6. Click "🚀 Add Planet to Solar System"

### Animation Controls
- **Real-time Rotation**: Enables planetary and orbital motion
- **Time Scale**: Speed up or slow down all animations (0.1x to 10x speed)
- **Individual Controls**: Each planet rotates at scientifically accurate relative speeds

### Camera Controls
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out
- **Click & Drag**: Rotate view around the solar system
- **Automatic Distance Detection**: Sun lighting adjusts based on camera distance

## Preset Configurations

### 🌍 Earth-Moon System
- Realistic Earth with single Moon
- Accurate size ratios and orbital mechanics

### 🪐 Jupiter System
- Gas giant Jupiter with 4 major moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto)
- Realistic moon orbital speeds and distances

### 💍 Saturn System
